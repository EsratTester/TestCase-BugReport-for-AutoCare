### â›³ Brief about the project website
AutoCare is an online  platform that connects vehicle owners with car service providers in Bangladesh. It allows users to book car servicing, repairs, and maintenance appointments online via a website or mobile app. The platform addresses the common issue of finding reliable auto services and helps streamline booking and tracking for users. Its target users include car owners, fleet managers, mechanics, and garages offering services.

## Test Cases
Main part of the project. After doing everything that helps to write and execute the test cases, more specifically. In this project, all the test cases have been executed without any delay.
There are 73 Pass test cases and 9 Fail test cases. It is only for the Registration and Login feature. There, I maintain a sequence of testing:
- Browser Compatibility
- UI testing
